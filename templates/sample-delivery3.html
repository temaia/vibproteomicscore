                  A <span class = "fond-weight-bold">thick poly styrene box</span> or special insulated box will reduce the amount of dry ice needed and allow extended shipping times.</p>

If there is any air space after you fill your package with dry ice, fill it with packing peanuts or other material to reduce the volume of air space.</p>
                <p class = "dubble-indent">
                  Make sure the box is <span class = "fond-weight-bold">not closed hermetically</span>. During transport, dry ice will sublimate and the gas should be able to escape from the box to prevent explosion.</p>

                <p class="dubble-indent">
                  Only reuse a box if you can personally <span class = "fond-weight-bold">verify it is not contaminated</span> and its <span class = "fond-weight-bold">integrity is intact</span>. (A box should not be reused if it is torn, cut, stained, or if the insulation is cracked or broken.)</p>
